# Project

Project management documentation: decisions, history, and ongoing work.

## Purpose

This folder answers "What happened and why?" — the living record of project evolution. Check here for context on past decisions and current work.

## Contents

- **tasks/** - Work in progress and task tracking
- **decisions/** - Decision records
- **changelog/** - History of completed work
- **pitfalls/** - Known gotchas and issues

## When to Add Docs Here

Add to `project/` when documenting:
- Technical decisions and their rationale
- Completed work (changelog entries)
- Known issues and workarounds
- Task specifications

For technical specs, use `reference/`. For how-to guides, use `guides/`.
