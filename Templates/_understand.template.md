# Understand

Core knowledge about the project: what it is, how it's built, and key domain concepts.

## Purpose

This folder answers "What IS this?" — the foundational context that agents need before they can work effectively. Read these docs when starting a new task or joining the project.

## Contents

- **about.md** - Project overview, purpose, and scope
- **architecture.md** - Technical structure and key components

## When to Add Docs Here

Add to `understand/` when documenting:
- Project purpose and goals
- System architecture and design
- Domain concepts that affect multiple areas
- Background knowledge agents need upfront

For how-to guides, use `guides/`. For API specs, use `reference/`.
