## Project Structure

<!-- Show your actual folder structure -->

```
project/
├── src/                  # Source code
├── tests/                # Test files
├── dydo/                 # Documentation
└── ...
```

## Key Components

<!-- List the major components/modules and what they do -->

### Component A

*What this component does and its responsibilities.*

---

## Data Flow

<!-- Describe how data flows through the system -->

```
Input → Processing → Output
```

---

## Where to Find Things

<!-- Quick lookup table for common tasks -->

| Looking for... | Location |
|----------------|----------|
| *[Type of code]* | `path/` |

---

## Key Decisions

*Link to decision records in `project/decisions/` for architectural choices.*

---

## Next Steps

After understanding the architecture:
- Read [../guides/coding-standards.md](../guides/coding-standards.md) for code style
- Read [../guides/how-to-use-docs.md](../guides/how-to-use-docs.md) for workflow commands
