# Coding Standards

The definition of quality code:
- Easy to understand, reason about
- Performant, follows best practices, follows existing patterns

**Perfection is attained, not when no more can be added, but when no more can be removed. Simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication.**

- Always think about modularity
    - This matters for testing, and maintainability.
- Code should be able to be tested.
- We aim for zero warnings throughout the codebase, but like most rules this has some [exceptions](deep_dives/miscelanious/warning-exceptions.md) like the unused vars in the Apphost.cs
