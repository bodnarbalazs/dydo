# Coding Standards

Quality code is easy to understand, reason about, performant, follows best practices, and follows existing patterns.

## Principles

**Perfection is attained, not when no more can be added, but when no more can be removed. Simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication.**

- Always think about modularity - this matters for testing and maintainability
- Code should be testable
- We aim for zero warnings throughout the codebase
