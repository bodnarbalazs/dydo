# Glossary

Definitions of domain-specific terms used throughout this project.
Only the most important, frequently used terms and concepts should be placed here.
It's purpose is to provide a quick context for the agents reading the docs about terms which are not immediately obvious.
Keep it around 15-20 terms max, don't make this an encylopedia, the rest of the docs are discoverable through normal search.

## How to Use

- Link to specific terms: `[Term](./glossary.md#term-name)`
