# DynaDocs - AI Agent Entry Point

Dynamic documentation and agent orchestration system. Provides structured context retrieval for AI agents and coordinates multi-agent workflows.

You need an assigned identity to work here.

---

## Your Identity

Check your prompt for an agent name (e.g., `Adele`, `Brian`).

**Found one?** → Go to **[agents/{name}/workflow.md](agents/)**

**None?** → Run `dydo agent claim auto`, then go to **agents/{assigned-name}/workflow.md**

Your prompt may include a --flag about your mode. Your workflow file explains everything.

---

## Disoriented?

Lost context? Run `dydo whoami`. It shows your identity, role, and task.

If claimed: check your workspace for notes, return to your mode file.
If not claimed: follow the flow above.
