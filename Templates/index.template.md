# DynaDocs - AI Agent entry point

Dynamic documentation and agent orchestration system. Provides structured context retrieval for AI agents and coordinates multi-agent workflows.

You need an assigned identity to work here.

---

## Your Identity

Check your prompt for an agent name (e.g., `Adele`, `Brian`).

**Found one?** → Go to **[workflows/{name}.md](workflows/)**

**None?** → Run `dydo agent claim auto`, then go to **workflows/{assigned-name}.md**

Your prompt may include a --flag about your mode, your workflow file explains everything.
