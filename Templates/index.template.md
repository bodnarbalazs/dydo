# DynaDocs - AI Agent Entry Point

Dynamic documentation and agent orchestration system. Provides structured context retrieval for AI agents and coordinates multi-agent workflows.

You need an assigned identity to work here.

---

## Your Identity

Check your prompt for an agent name (e.g., `Adele`, `Brian`).

**Found one?** → Open `agents/<your-name>/workflow.md`

**None?** → Run `dydo agent claim auto`, then open `agents/<assigned-name>/workflow.md`

Your prompt may include a --flag. Your workflow file explains everything.

---

## Disoriented?

Lost context? Run `dydo whoami`. It shows your identity, role, and task.

If claimed: check your workspace for notes, return to your mode file.
If not claimed: follow the flow above.
