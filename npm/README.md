# dydo

Context management and agent orchestration for AI coding assistants.

100% local, 100% under your control.

## The Problem

AI code editors forget everything between sessions. Every time you start, the agent wakes up with amnesia — no memory of your architecture, your conventions, or the context from yesterday.

So you explain the same things. Again. And again.

## The Solution

DynaDocs is a documentation-based approach. Your docs **ARE** the memory.

Think of it like Groundhog Day: the AI wakes up fresh each session, but you've left it a note explaining everything it needs to know. It reads the note, onboards itself, and gets to work.

A CLI enforces roles and permissions — the reviewer can't edit code, the code-writer can't touch docs, and no agent reviews its own work.
